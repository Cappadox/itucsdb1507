Parts Implemented by Seda Yıldırım
==================================

The following three tables were implemented: **Fixtures**, **Player Statistics**, and **Team Statistics**. The tabs Fixtures and Statistics can be seen on the navigation bar above the site interface.
The **Player** and **Team Statistics pages** were grouped to one tab to provide better navigation since the navigation bar is in alphabetical order. Both pages can be seen on the drop down menu.
